#setviewport

A small JS script to insert the viewport meta tag into an HTML document's head at a specified width.


## Basic Use:

Insert the viewport.min.js code in the document `head`, preferably at the earliest point after the opening `<head>` tag.
Find the function call 'mobileWidth(600);` and set it to the width (in pixels) that you want the viewport tag to render.

The default viewport metatag settings are: `width=device-width initial-scale=1`

Note that it also has orientation detection and substitution, so that rotated devices will use the widest aspect.


## Available Vars:

The function `mobileWidth();` adds two variables to the global window object:

`objectWidth` - the smaller of window or screen, based on device orientation.

`triggerWidth` -  the width you set when calling `mobileWidth(600)` to trigger `setviewport();`
